# mapper
OurMap is a Geographic Information System, similar to Google Maps

# Milestone Deliverables
You can find the milestone deliverables in /libstreetmap/src
1. m1.cpp contains basic street mapping functions.
2. m2.cpp contains code dealing with UI.
3. m3.cpp contains our Dijkstra to  nd shortest path between intersections and points of interest.
4. m4.cpp is our current, ongoing milestone. This contains our algorithm to optimize our traveling salesman problem. This milestone is actually a competition between us and our classmates as well as TAs, who can make the better QoR?
5. mapDataStruct.cpp contains the class in which my team stores the majority if not all of our data structures
Have fun!
