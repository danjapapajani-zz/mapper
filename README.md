4. m4.cpp is our current, ongoing milestone. This contains our algorithm to optimize our traveling salesman problem. This milestone is actually a competition between us and our classmates as well as TAs, who can make the better QoR? You can read more @ http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~czajkow/ece297/ECE297/assignments/a4/a4.pdf
5. mapDataStruct.cpp contains the class in which my team stores the majority if not all of our data structures
Have fun!
